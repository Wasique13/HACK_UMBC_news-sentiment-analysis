# TopicSentimentAnalysis
This is small web application which given a topic or subject in the news does sentiment analysis using natural language processing to create datasets and display the sentiment on a given topic.

It uses the following libraries: 
  * [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) (to manage the front-end), 
  * [retext-sentiment](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-sentiment) (for NLP sentiment analysis),
  * [insert RSS feed library here]
